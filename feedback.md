I am a learning blockchain developer and only just recently finshed my first project on ethereum.  Coming from a place of very little experience I was impressed with how easy the Laika app was to use. 

Writing the actual smart contracts is not the hard part of development for beginners with some sort of coding experience.  The hard part is connecting an an ethereum node on the frontend and actually calling those functions once the contract is deployed on the network.  The Laika app makes this a much easier and begginer friendly process.

Pros:
- Dark Mode is great
- Very user friendly interface.  Can see what a functions a contract has, its parameters, and what it returns all very clearly
- Helps visualize smart contract and its functions, like a menu you can order from
- Love that it shows the type of function (i.e view, pure)  This is one of the more confusing parts of solidity and helps make it clear what each function does
- Code snippets of what is going on under the hood is a great way for user to learn.  

Improvements:
- When writing to the blockchain, which we do for the register function, that change has to be included in a block and mined.  That means there is a long loading   time.  This is not expressed to the user and those new to blockchain development (your target audience) may become confused
- Didn't find code snipper button until I was done.  Great feature that I think is at a weird place on interface.
